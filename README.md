# CoronavirusForm

This is an application for submitting a form.

## Getting started

The instructions will help you to get the application running
locally on your machine.

### Prequisites

You'll need an Amazon DynamoDB local instance running in a docker container.

You'll need a JavaScript runtime: https://github.com/rails/execjs  
Clone the app and run `bundle` locally.  

### Running DynamoDB

#### Docker
Run the following to set up the local version of DynamoDB

```
     docker pull amazon/dynamodb-local
     docker run -d -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local
 ```

### Running Redis

#### Locally

    brew install redis
    brew services start redis

### Running the application (DynamoDB will need to be running)

    foreman start

### Running the tests

    bundle exec rake


## Deployment pipeline

Every commit to master is deployed to GOV.UK PaaS by
[this concourse pipeline](https://cd.gds-reliability.engineering/teams/govuk-tools/pipelines/govuk-coronavirus-business-volunteer-form),
which is configured in [concourse/pipeline.yml](concourse/pipeline.yml).

The concourse pipeline has credentials for the `govuk-forms-deployer` user in
GOV.UK PaaS. This user has the SpaceDeveloper role, so it can `cf push` the application.
